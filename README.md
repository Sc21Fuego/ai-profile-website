    --Challenges: 
        -Working from new workstation, credentials not cached for GitHub. SSH public key not yet configured for 
        this repo. 
        --Solution: 
            -Created access token, configured permissions, loaded token to new device. 
            -Long term, need to configure SSH key for this repo and set up git clone with SSH instead of HTTPS
